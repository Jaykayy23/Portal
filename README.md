# SomoExpress — Merchant Delivery Portal

A merchant delivery request & pricing tool: merchants log delivery requests with
distance-based pricing, ops/admin assign riders, and everyone gets one-tap
WhatsApp/SMS alerts.

**Next.js** app on **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth).

## 1. Setup

**Requirements:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18.18+ and a Supabase project.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` from your Supabase dashboard (**Project Settings → API keys**):

| Variable | Where to find it | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Project URL | |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Publishable key (`sb_publishable_…`) | Safe in browsers — RLS protects the data, not this key |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Secret key (`sb_secret_…`) | **Server only.** Bypasses RLS. Never rename to `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` |

### Apply the schema

```bash
npx supabase login
```

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

The project ref is the subdomain of your project URL. `db push` will ask for the
database password (**Project Settings → Database**).

To confirm it worked, and to catch any security or performance advice:

```bash
npx supabase db advisors
```

### Run it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:4000**. With no accounts yet you'll get the
create-admin screen; that account then creates everyone else.

For production, `npm run build` then `npm start`.

### Regenerating database types

`lib/database.types.ts` is hand-written to match the migrations. Once linked, you
can replace it with generated output so it tracks the schema automatically:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --linked > lib/database.types.ts
```

## 2. How auth works

Supabase Auth is email-based; this portal is username-based. So each account gets
a **synthetic email** derived from its username — `jumia.gh` becomes
`jumia.gh@portal.somoexpress.local` — and the UI never shows it. People type a
username, exactly as before.

Consequences worth knowing:

- The domain is deliberately not real. Nothing is ever delivered to these
  addresses, so email flows (reset links, magic links, confirmations) don't apply.
  Password resets stay an admin action that reveals the new password once.
- `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_DOMAIN` in [lib/identity.ts](lib/identity.ts) is effectively
  permanent. Changing it after accounts exist orphans every login.
- Accounts are created with the service-role key, so provisioning always happens
  server-side, and the plaintext password is returned exactly once to whoever
  created it.
- **Ops creates merchant accounts only.** Because the create path runs as
  service_role it bypasses RLS, so that limit lives in
  [app/api/accounts/route.ts](app/api/accounts/route.ts) — an ops caller asking
  for any role but `merchant` gets a 403. Resetting a password and
  activating/deactivating stay admin-only. Ops can read merchant profile rows
  (and only those) so the Merchants pane can list them.

Roles live in the JWT's **`app_metadata`**, never `user_metadata` — the latter is
editable by the account holder and must not be trusted for authorization.

**Deactivating an account** does two things: bans the auth user (which revokes
their token at the source) and clears `profiles.active` (which the server checks
on every request). Either alone would leave a window open.

## 3. Security model

Three layers, each independently sufficient for the common case:

1. **Proxy** — no valid session cookie, no portal. Refreshes the session on
   every request via `getClaims()`, which verifies the JWT against the project's
   public JWKS with no network round-trip.
2. **Route Handlers and pages** — `requireUser('admin')` / `roleAllows(...)` on
   every entry point, returning clean 401/403s.
3. **Row Level Security** — the backstop. `supabase/migrations` enforces the rules
   in Postgres, so a forgotten filter in application code cannot leak data.

The main upgrade over the previous JSON-file version: **merchant isolation is now
a database guarantee**, not an application one. A merchant's `SELECT` on
`deliveries` can only ever return rows where they are the merchant.

Who can reach what:

| Table | anon | merchant | ops | admin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `branding` (logo) | read | read | read | read + write |
| `pricing_params` | — | read | read | read + write |
| `delivery_options` | — | read | read | read + write |
| `profiles` | — | own row | own row + merchant rows | all + write |
| `deliveries` | — | own rows, insert | all, update | all, update |
| `riders` | — | — | read + write | read + write |
| `app_settings` (API keys) | — | — | — | via server only |

`app_settings` is granted to **no** public role: the WhatsApp/SMS provider keys
are only ever read by the server's service-role client, after the caller has been
confirmed as admin. RLS is enabled on it with zero policies as a second line of
defence.

Two deliberate exceptions:

- **The logo is world-readable.** The login screen has to render it before anyone
  signs in. It lives in its own table so that "public" never overlaps with the
  secrets.
- **The Google Maps key reaches signed-in browsers.** The Maps JavaScript SDK
  runs client-side, so there's no alternative. Restrict the key by HTTP referrer
  in Google Cloud Console.

---

## 4. What's real vs. what's a manual trigger

- **Pricing** is recalculated server-side from the saved parameters. The form
  shows a live preview, but the stored number is the server's, so a client can't
  submit a fabricated price — nor file a request under another merchant's name.
- **Item categories** (what is being sent — food, medication, documents…) are a
  list an admin edits under Settings, stored in `delivery_options`. The New
  delivery form requires a choice whenever the list is non-empty, and the Route
  Handler re-checks the submitted label against the configured list. The chosen
  label is copied onto the delivery row, the same way rider details are, so
  renaming or removing a category never rewrites past records.
- **Google Maps** (autocomplete + driving-distance lookup) works once an admin
  saves a Maps API key with Places API and Distance Matrix API enabled and billing
  on.
- **WhatsApp/SMS alerts** are one-tap `wa.me` / `sms:` links that pre-fill the
  message — whoever's at the keyboard taps send. The WhatsApp and SMS **API key
  fields** are stored ready for a provider integration (Twilio, Africa's Talking,
  Meta's WhatsApp Business API), but unattended sending isn't implemented. Start
  from `whatsapp_otp_key` / `sms_api_key` in [lib/settings.ts](lib/settings.ts).

---

## 5. Deployment

The app is now **stateless** — all state is in Supabase — so it scales
horizontally and can run anywhere, including serverless platforms like Vercel.
(The previous JSON-file version could not.)

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Note that `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are inlined into the client bundle at **build**
time, so `docker-compose.yml` passes them as build args as well as runtime env.
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is runtime-only and never becomes an image layer.

Put a reverse proxy in front for TLS. Example with **Nginx**:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name portal.somoexpress.example;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Backups

Supabase takes automated backups — see **Database → Backups** in the dashboard.
For your own copy:

```bash
npx supabase db dump --linked -f backup.sql
```

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **"Supabase admin client needs …"** — `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is missing from
  `.env`. Restart the dev server after adding it.
- **Everything 500s with "relation does not exist"** — migrations haven't been
  applied. Run `npx supabase db push`.
- **A signed-in user sees no data** — RLS is doing its job but the role claim is
  missing or stale. Roles come from `app_metadata.portal_role`, which is set at
  account creation and only refreshes when the token does; sign out and back in.
- **"Incorrect username or password"** for an account you just created — check the
  password was copied from the one-time reveal dialog. Supabase returns the same
  message for an unknown username, on purpose.
- **Everyone bounced to login after a deploy** — check the Supabase URL and
  publishable key were present at build time, not just at runtime.
- **Forgot the admin password** — reset it from the Supabase dashboard
  (**Authentication → Users**), or `psql`/SQL editor against `auth.users`.

## 7. Migrating from the JSON-file version

The previous release stored everything in `data/db.json`. That file and its
loader are gone. If you have a populated one from an older deploy, note that
passwords **cannot** be carried over — bcrypt hashes can't be imported into
Supabase Auth through the admin API. Recreate the accounts and hand out fresh
passwords; riders, deliveries, pricing and settings can be inserted directly.
